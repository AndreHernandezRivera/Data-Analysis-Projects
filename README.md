# GBC-Group-10---Big-5-Personality-Data-Project

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to a personality test dataset to see what features could be predicted on for classification. 

In the notebook, I attempted to see if country country classification could work based on personalities, and other characteristics.

This project shows my use of various advanced data visualization tools, like the 3D scatter plot in plotly, as well as basic data wrangling.

The penguins folder is an entirely different dataset, well known to machine learning prediction, where I experiment with what a traditional preprocessing and  binary classification could look like.
