# GBC-Group-10---Big-5-Personality-Data-Project

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to a personality test dataset to see what features could be predicted on for classification.

This project shows my use of various advanced data visualization tools, like the 3D scatter plot in plotly, as well as basic data wrangling.
